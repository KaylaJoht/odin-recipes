    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>This Italian-American classic is a classic for a reason! Relatively simple, but extrordinarily delicious. While you can enjoy this recipe as just plain chicken, I decided to help elevate it by introducing some noodles, and broccoli. Those additional meals elevate the flavor to something even more delicious.</p>

    <p>Just bread your chicken in a mix of breadcrumbs and parmesan, bake in the oven for a few minutes to melt a topping of mozzerella, and you'll be left with possibly the best way to eat chicken, bursting with incredible amounts of flavor. With that in mind, lets get started!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3-4 Chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1 cup of flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup of Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>24oz Marinara sauce</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Mozzerella Cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Optional</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>Spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>Broccoli</li>
        <li>Lemon juice</li>
        <li>Chili flakes</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees</li>
        <li>In a small pot, heat the marinara sauce. Once it boils, leave it on low heat</li>
        <li>Put your flour on a plate, beat the eggs on a separate plate</li>
        <li>Mix the breadcrumbs, parmesan, salt, pepper, and paprika on a plate</li>
        <li>Take your chicken and slice it in half across the side. The idea is to get two slices of chicken at half the thickness. Similar to butterfly-ing chicken</li>
        <li>Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture first, rememebr to shake off excess flour. Then the egg wash, and finally thr breadcrumb mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour oil into a pan and heat on Medium heat</li>
        <li>Cook the chicken for about 4 minutes on each side</li>
        <li>When the chicken is done, move it to a baking dish</li>
        <li>Put a dollop of marinara on top, sprinkle it with mozzerella cheese, and top with salt and pepper. Place in the oven for about 10 minutes, or until the cheese melts</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>If you wish to make the side dishes, here you go</p>

    <ol>
        <li>You can start this any time, but I would start it after instruction 2</li>
        <li>In a large pot boil some water. Add salt to taste</li>
        <li>when the water boils, add the spaghetti noodles. Cook until al dente</li>
        <li>Strain the noodles, while in the strainer, add olive oil, salt, and pepper. Mix</li>
        <li>Add a small amount of Marinara sauce</li>
        <li> they are ready to serve</li>
        <li>While the chicken is in the oven, either re-use the chicken pan, or get a clean pan</li>
        <li>Heat to a medium heat. When hot, add lemon juice, broccoli, and chili flakes</li>
        <li>Cook for a few minutes until the broccol is cooked to your liking. You might need to add a a lid to stream it a little</li>
        <li>With the chicken done, plate with spaghetti and brocolli</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
