    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>The chocolate cake to end all chocoalte cakes! The lava cakes provides exceptional chocolaty goodness, while being relatively simple to make, and under 30 minutes. A recipe that is both elegant and delicious, and will leave all your guests wanting for more. All you need are 6oz rammikens, and you can do anything!</p>

    <p>You can use virtually any chocolate you want, but I prefer the classic combination of Dark chocolate and semi-sweet! Timing is key for this recipe, as you don't want an undercooked cake, or a cake missing lava. If the cake cracks on your first try, don't worry! We all start somewhere, and no one will care what the cake looks like when they're gobbling it up. Now, let's get started!</p>
