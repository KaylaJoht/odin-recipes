    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>The chocolate cake to end all chocoalte cakes! The lava cakes provides exceptional chocolaty goodness, while being relatively simple to make, and under 30 minutes. A recipe that is both elegant and delicious, and will leave all your guests wanting for more. All you need are 6oz rammikens, and you can do anything!</p>

    <p>You can use virtually any chocolate you want, but I prefer the classic combination of Dark chocolate and semi-sweet! Timing is key for this recipe, as you don't want an undercooked cake, or a cake missing lava. If the cake cracks on your first try, don't worry! We all start somewhere, and no one will care what the cake looks like when they're gobbling it up. Now, let's get started!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>6oz of Dark Chocolate</li>
        <li>2oz of semi-sweet chocolate</li>
        <li>10 Tbsp of Butter</li>
        <li> 1 1/2 cups of Powdered Sugar </li>
        <li>1/2 cup of flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>3 egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp of vannila </li>
        <li>2tbsp of orange liquer</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can use any combination of chocalates, or only one type of chocolate! The important thing is having 8 oz of chocolate total!</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: If you don't have Orange liquer, you can always use orange extract, just use 1 tsp for every 1 tbsp!</p>
    <p><strong>NOTE</strong>: You can use any flour you want! So the recipe can easily be gluten-free!</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees</li>
        <li>Take six 4oz rammikens and coat them with butter (If you don't want a buttery exterior, you can also coat them with powdered sugar)</li>
        <li>In a double boiler, melt the chocolate and butter, make sure to whisk regularly! (You can also melt in the microwave in 30 second increments)</li>
        <li>Once the chocoalte and butter are melted and mixed, remove from heat (if using double boiler) and add the flour and powdered sugar. Lightly mix, about 10 seconds</li>
        <li>Mix in the eggs and egg yolks. Immediately start mixing so the eggs don't cook!</li>
        <li>Once the mixture is free of all clumps and consistently colored, mix in the vanilla and orange liquer (or extract), until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Pour into rammikens, and bake for 14 minutes</li>
        <li>Remove from rammiken by running a knife around the edge, and flipping it out with a plate.</li>
        <li>Top with powdered sugar and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
