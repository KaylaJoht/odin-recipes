# odin-recipes

This is a project for [The odin project ](https://www.theodinproject.com/). In this lesson I create a website that holds recipes.

As of right now, I am only doing HTML. I already know HTML, in fact I have my own website up. However, I want to go through this project until I get to javascript, in case there is anything I am missing. 

So lessons learned: Linking pages, adding images, making lists, and making commits
